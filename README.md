## Introduction

Motion detection is one of the fundamentals approach for identification of any activity in the vicinity. Considering the dynamic nature of a drone and unpredictable movements, along with accuracy,
robustness and rapid detection is the very need of such methods to work with drones. Observing the
requirements some very fundamental motion detection algorithms were taken.

A comparative analysis of 3 major algorithms namely:

```
1. Adaptive Background subtraction
2. 3 frame difference
3. Hybrid Algorithm

```

In most of the situations, drone will be send to locations with no prior knowledge of the scenario.
Thus, for analysis of robustness of algorithms following challenges are considered in the analysis images:

```
1. Presence of Stationary objects
2. Dynamic Background
3. Illumination Changes
```

### Execution
* There are 3 python notebook which uses primary system camera for execution.
* Simply open each notebook in jupyter and run cells step by step.

Further details about theory and sample results are present in each notebook.
